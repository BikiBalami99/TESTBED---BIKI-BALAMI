# My Dev Knowledge Collection

This repo is basically my personal brain dump for all the development stuff I keep forgetting exactly how to implement, even though I know it exists somewhere in my mind.

## What's in here?

**Stuffs I always reuse or I may use. For Example:**

- Handy CSS resets I put at the start of every project
- Cool animations and transitions I spent hours perfecting
- Useful code snippets and patterns I know I'll need again
- Solutions to problems I always seem to run into

**The goal:** Never have to reinvent the wheel for the same problems I keep solving over and over.

## Can you steal my code?

Yes. If you find anything cool or fun, please feel free to re-use them withou asking. I'd appreciate a star though.
